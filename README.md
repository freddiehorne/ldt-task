There are a few duplicates in the data so I installed nanoid to create individual keys for the map methods.

The filter can be used by typing the organiser name, event name or the surname of a customer or it can be filtered by using the dropdown which only filters by organiser name

I was unsure of the units for the ticket price so I left it as it is

If more time I would go back and make this as some sort of table to display the info in a better way
